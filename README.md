# Task Management System

Full Stack Project:
Frontend: Angular
Backend: Node.js
Database: SQL

## TL;DR
Task Management System is a web application for managing tasks and assignments. It combines an Angular + TypeScript frontend with a Node.js + Express backend, backed by SQL Server for persistent data storage.

## Overview
Task Management System provides a task management interface where users can create, view, update, and organize tasks. The frontend is built with Angular for a responsive user experience, while the backend API handles all business logic, user authentication, and database operations through SQL Server.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Task-Management-System

cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

> Note: Ensure SQL Server is properly configured and accessible before running the backend.

## Running the project

### Backend
From the `server` folder:
```bash
npm start
```
The Express server runs on port `3000` (or the configured port in your environment).

### Frontend
From the `client` folder:
```bash
npm start
```
This starts the Angular development server on port `4200`.

### Production / Build
The frontend can be built with:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
This generates optimized production files in the `dist/` directory.

## Environment variables

### Server
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```env
DB_SERVER=localhost\SQLEXPRESS
DB_NAME=TaskManagementDB
DB_DRIVER=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
```

### Client
Before running the frontend, ensure that `client/public/config/ipConfig.json` contains the correct backend API address.
